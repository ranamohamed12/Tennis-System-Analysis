### Tennis System Analysis:
A deep learning-based computer vision project to track and analyze tennis players' movements for performance insights and to enhance coaching strategies. This project leverages object detection, tracking, and pose estimation techniques to process video data and extract meaningful insights about player performance.


## Features
- Player Detection and Tracking: Utilizes YOLOv8 to detect players and YOLOV5 for tennis balls, and object tracking to follow movements across video frames.
- Performance Analytics: Extracts player movement trajectories and key on-court events to provide actionable performance metrics.
- Visualizations: Creates overlays on video frames to visualize player movements and events for analysis.


## Technologies Used
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy
- Object Detection: YOLOv8, YOLOV5
- Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
- Video Processing : OpenCV
